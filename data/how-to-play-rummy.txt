So grab a deck of cards or open the A23 app on your phone, round up some friends, and get ready to play!

The Objective of a Rummy Card Game
The main goal in Rummy is to discard all the cards in your hand as fast as possible. You do this by forming groups of cards called sets and runs/sequences.

Sets are easy to remember - they are simply three or four cards that have the same number but different suits. For instance, three 7s or four Kings would be sets.
Runs or Sequences are also straightforward. They are three or more cards of the same suit in a row, like 5♥, 6♥, and 7♥.
The key to winning Rummy is to combine your cards into sets and sequences strategically. Once you have created a set or run, you can place it down on the table, getting rid of those cards from your hand. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game!

How to Play Rummy?
Rummy is a fun card game for 2 to 6 players. Here is how to play:

Get the Cards: Grab 2 decks of cards.
Deal the Cards: Each player gets 13 cards dealt face down. One card is chosen at random to be the wild card, like a Joker card.
Goal of the Game: Be the first player to get rid of all your cards!
On your turn, you can draw a card from either the face-down deck or the discard pile where other players have thrown away cards. You cannot just hold onto any cards, though! You need to use them to form "melds." These melds can be:

Sets: Three or four cards of the same rank but different suits (like three 7s or four Queens).
Runs or Sequences: Three or more cards of the same suit in a row (like 6♥, 7♥, 8♥).
Rummy Guide on Winning the Game:
while a run contains three or more cards of the same suit in a sequence, like ♥A  ♥2  ♥3 (see what we did there?). This variation of Rummy is called basic/traditional rummy - there are other variants as well. Once you have at least two sequences, including one made entirely of consecutive cards in the same suit, a pure sequence, and all your other cards are in melds, you can declare "Rummy!" and show your hand. If your melds are valid, you win the round.

So, now you must be aware of how to play cards in rummy! Let us now move on to the next section, where we will learn about the calculation of points in the game.

How are Points Calculated in a Rummy Game as per Rummy Rules?
In Rummy, keeping track of points is key to knowing who wins and loses. Here is a quick reference for scoring each card:

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King, Ace): These are worth 10 points each.
Numbered cards: These are easy to remember. They simply count their face value in points (a 7 is 7 points, an 8 is 8 points, and so on).
Jokers: Jokers score 0 points.
When a round ends, any cards you have not melded (used in sets or sequences) are added up according to their point value. The player with the lowest total points wins the round.

Common Rummy Rules for Point Calculation
In Points Rummy, winning requires declaring zero points after organising your 13 cards into valid sequences and sets.

Here is how it works:

To win, you must declare before others with all 13 cards arranged in valid sequences and sets, totalling zero points. This makes Rummy fast-paced.

Point Calculation for Losing Players:
If you have not formed any of the two compulsory sequences, you get points equal to the total points of your 13 cards, maxing out at 80 points.
If you have the compulsory sequences but have not grouped the rest, you get points from the ungrouped cards.
If you fail to meet the objective, you get points from all 13 cards regardless of sequences.
How are Your Winnings Calculated in Rummy Cash Games?
In Points Rummy, a version of the classic 13-card Indian Rummy, players engage in a thrilling contest where each card carries a predetermined rupee value. The objective is to be the first player to declare with zero points, securing victory and claiming all the cash stakes based on opponents' accumulated points.

This format is renowned for its speed and simplicity, making it one of the most favoured variations of Rummy.

The calculation for winnings in Points Rummy is straightforward yet pivotal:

Winnings = (Total Points of Opponents) X (Rupee Value of Each Point) - A23 Fees

Rummy Rules: Important Terms
Are you still learning the ropes of the Rummy card game? This section is for you! We will break down some key terms you will encounter throughout the game.

Understanding these words will help you play smoothly, strategise effectively, and impress your fellow Rummy enthusiasts!

Rummy Table
Imagine a virtual table where you and your opponents battle it out with cards. This "table" is simply the space where cards are dealt, drawn, and discarded during the game. In online Rummy, the table will be displayed on your screen.

Rummy Sets:
These are groups of 3 or 4 cards with the same rank but different suits. For example, three 9s (one Spade, one Heart, and one Diamond) or four Queens (of any suit) would be valid sets.

Rummy Sequences:
These are three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For instance, 3♦, 4♦, and 5♦ or 9♠, 10♠, Jack♠, Queen♠ would be sequences.

Pure Sequence:
This is the golden standard for sequences. It is a run of consecutive cards with the same suit, built without any wild cards. For example, 3♣, 4♣, and 5♣ is a pure sequence. In some variations of Rummy, you might need at least one pure sequence to declare Rummy.

Impure Sequence:
This sequence uses a wild card, like a joker, to bridge the gap between consecutive cards. For instance, 7♣, 8♣, Wild Card, and 9♣ is an impure sequence. While some variations allow impure sequences, they might not hold the same weight as pure sequences.

Draw and Discard
Draw: On your turn, you can draw a card from either the face-down deck, i.e., the fresh cards, or the discard pile, i.e., the cards thrown away by other players. This lets you build your hand and potentially find the cards you need to form sets or sequences.

Discard: After drawing a card, you must discard one card face-up onto the discard pile. This might be a card you do not need or a strategic move to mislead your opponents.

Sorting of Cards
Sorting your cards by suit and rank can significantly improve your gameplay. This allows you to see what sets and sequences you can potentially form easily and helps you plan your strategy.

Drop
In some variations of Rummy card games, dropping allows you to leave the game early if you think your hand is weak. However, this often comes with a penalty in the form of points added to your score.

Chips
In online Rummy, chips might be used as a virtual currency to enter cash tournaments or play practice games. Think of them as tokens for playing the game.

Jokers and Wild Cards
Joker: A special card that can act as any other card to complete a set or sequence. However, jokers might have specific rules depending on the Rummy variation you are playing. This comes in the form of a printed Joker card.

Wild Card: Similar to a joker, a wild card can substitute for other cards. The specific rules for wild cards will depend on the game variation. Sometimes, a chosen card from the deck becomes the wild card.

Cash Tournaments
These are online Rummy tournaments where players compete for real money prizes. A certain amount of money might be required to participate, and the winner takes home the pot of collected prize money
